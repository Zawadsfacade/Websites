This dish was something I created on the fly. 
I was very hungry one afternoon and I had to babysit. 
So I looked at the fridge and used up random items from the field to make something.
It was just bread with a fried egg on top and some leftover pasta rolled over.Coated with Tarmarind sauce. 
This was the first time I ever cooked. To this day, this ended up being one of the best snacks I just make whenever I am hungry. And today I am going to share the recipe with you all.
